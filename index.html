        <h3><u>Przyborowski Works</u></h3>
            <p>Hello!  My name is Michael Przyborowski, and I thank you for browsing my digital portfolio!  These works are 
            a collection of my works to display what I've done, and what I am currently capable of with traditional and digital media.
            I've been drawing for a long as I can remember, and hope to bolster my career with my art.  Currently I am pursuing a digital
            Media degree with a focus in game-design

                <h5><i>People Scream, but I Have No Ears</i></h5>
                <p>This is a portrait I did of one of my classmates for my junior year breadth portfolio.  I used a combination of Micron Pens and
                Copic Markers for the hands and face, and for the scarf and background, I used crayola markers, and then watered them down to get that watery
                texture for the background, hair, and jacket.  I thought to differentiate between solid and watery colors and shapes would help the actual portrait
                pop out more.  The title is a reference to my classmate.  She had, and probably still has, a fascination with the shapes of ears, and used ears as 
                her the basic subject matter for her portfolios.  I thought it was ironic in the reference I took, her ears were covered by her scarf, hence the title.

                <h5><i>StarFox</i></h5>
                <p>This is a digitally made portrait made in Clip Studio of a dear friends beloved dog, appropriately named "Fox". Fox is a goofy boy, and is an excellent photo model.  
                    When this referencephoto was shown to me, I couldn't resist trying to capture his magesty.  I've always preferred painting in a messier fashion, with my brush 
                    strokes in clear display, especially in this piece as I believe it gives the fur a much better texture.  I used some subtle pen work in certain areas the accentuate
                    certain areas as well.

                alt="A Swarm of Agressive Bees">
                <h5><i>Swarm</i></h5>
                <p>This is a traditional work I did as part of my senior portfolio.  For said portfolio, I used bird's as my main subject matter, and attempted to capture them in natural,
                    yet jarring compositions.  I unfortunately can't remember the name of the species of this bird, but I do remember my thought process for this composition:  They look like
                    bees, so I'll have them act like bees.  This piece shows many of these small black and yellow birds buzzing around, and feeding at a bird feeder in the background.  I used
                    color pencil, and watered down acrylic for the background.  I even ripped off bits of the paper for the background to give the work extra texture.  The texture that is seen 
                    throughout the work was made using Leatherette paper as my canvas, and tremendously helped in making my work much more interesting to view.

                alt="The ravenous Potoo Serpeant carrying its young">
                <h5><i>Great Potoo Serpeant</i></h5>
                <p>The great Potoo Serpeant is probably one of my favorite works made throughout my senior portfolio as I feel like I was able to truly capture what I had envisioned with a
                    piece.  The Potoo bird is a bizzare and frightening bird with a massive mouth.  They are usually compared to frog mouths, but I saw something different.  The idea for my composition
                    was something I didn't even think about, as it just pieced itself together as I drew it out.  This work also employs color pencil and watered down acrylics, along with the 
                    leatherette paper as a base.
